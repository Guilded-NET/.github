# ðŸŸ¡ Guilded.NET
</div>

Guilded.NET is a free and open-source unofficial API wrapper for [Guilded](https://guilded.gg/) written on .NET platform. It allows creating bots, webhooks and interacting any other way with Guilded API.

## âœ… Goals

Our goal is to provide a library that is consistent and fast, while also maintaining friendliness towards the bot developers. API library that does not bite bot developer's hand allows bot developers to focus more on their code, have fun in what they are doing and have easier time creating their bots. Consistency helps code be more predictable, easier to rewrite and waste less time. As such, these 3 points are our main goals while maintaining Guilded.NET.
